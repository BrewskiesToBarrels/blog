<!-- Now that I've given you guys the bullshit intro, here's my real origin story: I didn't really drink until I was 18. **BE CAREFUL, THE FOLLOWING STORY MIGHT BE BORING**

I know this is unheard of, but all through highschool I didn't drink, I stuck to my pre-calc homework. All of this changed when I went on a trip with my best friend Ethan to Europe. We went on a "tour" with a company called Contiki, at the the time the tour was called the "Original", which I believe has now been discontinued; it include 46 days of camping in tents, visiting a total of 22 countries. Ethan and I took a flight from good ol' YVR to the Detroit Airport, saying goodbye to our parents who were probably scared to death letting a 17 and 18 year old go alone to Europe on a 2 month trip. From Detroit, we went to Gatwick Airport, where we arrived with our suitcases, and a map to our hotel. 

We were supposed to meet the rest of the group at this hotel, but since neither of use had been to London before, we decided to arrive a day early to experience the city. The first day we arrived we were overtaken by the overwhelming feeling of finally being independent (even though we were still dependent on our parents money), and decided to visit all the typical tourist sites. After a long day of walking around the city with my best friend, We decided to stop by the nearby Tesco's and get two huge bottles of beer (If I'm not mistaken, they were Heineken and Budweiser). We took these back to our hotel room, and drank them in front of our crappy TV watching typical British TV. This was our first beer away from our parents. 

Now, roughly 4 days later, we've met up and travelled with our group towards the middle of France. I've already been introduced to most of the group, and were just getting to know each other, but everything changed when we got to Beaujolais: we finally got our first taste of alcohol. We got to the campsite at Beaujolais, Ethan set up our tent as per usual, and we went to the local grocery store to pick up the basic provisions and alcohol. Most of the guys on the trip were Australian, as is with most Contiki trips, so when Ethan and I spotted a bottle of Canadian whisky, we knew we had to represent (This bottle could not be found in Canada, I'm not sure if its because this bottle is spectacular, but it did cost less than 10â‚¬). This is where it all started, we went through the rest of the trip, and drank our fair share of alcohol but that was the beginning. My relationship with alcohol continued to be negative.

Lets move two year later, my 20th birthday, an awkward milestone between when you can drink in Canada and the U.S (Stupid government rules). My aunt took be to a very nice steakhouse called Gotham's for my birthday.  I had been getting into scotches for a little while, gradually ameliorating my relationship with alcohol, having bought scotches such as the Aberlour 12, Laphroaig 10 (which I hated at the time), and the Macallan 12. I asked the Bartender what "non-peated" whiskey she recommended, she then recommended the Balvenie 14 Caribbean Cask. I did not expect it, but alongside the steak tartare, the Balvenie 14 just tickled all the right spots.  I was able to sit there with the same glass of whisky for over an hour, and even though that one glass of whisky costed my aunt over $50, **it was really the catalyst into my scotch obsession.** 

After that night, I quickly went and bought myself a bottle of the Balvenie 14, and to this day, it is one of my most mediocre scotches. This scotch changed my views on liquor with a single glass, and **I think most people who get into scotch can tell you about the single glass that made them realize the beauty of scotch.** 

I think the final take-away from this story is that no matter how "low-class" or "trashy" your initial relationship with liquor is, its never too late to explore the beautiful world that exists behind the cheap beer and Smirnoff. I have a **100%** success rate at converting people into scotch drinkers, and I don't plan on ruining that success rate. 

This is really the background I planned on putting out there in case people cared, and I think its important to show that I was no different to the typical Joe, I just decided to try out scotch, and ended up seeing how beautiful the world of whisk(e)y can be. I hope to continue these blog posts, and further explain the world of whisk(e)y to you guys. -->
