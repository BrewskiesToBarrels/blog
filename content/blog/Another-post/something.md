Welcome to the first ever blogpost. You're here at the ground level, meaning you're either a really good friend, or an absolute weirdo; either way, welcome!

The idea behind **Brewskies to Barrels** is to teach young people about fine spirits, because there is a whole world you're overlooking when you're crushing white claws and doing keg stands. Like most things in my life, I got slightly interested in a topic, and I completely exaggerated and learned every detail I could find. The idea is in the name, I want to forcefully evolve our generation from the "brewskie" crushing idiots we are, to the slightly finer, whisk(e)y drinking morons we have the potential to be.

The idea with this blog is to simply post about higher end liquors, which seem to have been my interest in the past year (don't judge, quarantine's been rough). I will focus mostly on whisk(e)y (bet you didn't know there's multiple ways of spelling it), but will diverge into different alcoholic beverages when I feel is right. The first few posts will be quite surface level, as I think most people reading this have minimal to no experience with high end beverages, which is totally fine, I just want to provide people with the basic knowledge so that the next time you go out to a fancy dinner, you're able to look like you actually know what the fuck you're talking about (trust me, even the dumbest terms can impress people). 

I think this blog will serve as a good starting point for your journey, keep an open mind, try to listen to my long-winded, potentially boring stories, and it might serve you well in the long run. I hope that you enjoy what I write!
