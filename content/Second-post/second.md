Let me begin: Welcome to my first blog post. I wanted to start off simple, with explaining what whisky is, and how I got into the whisky “game”

I want to preface this video by explaining that I will not be going excessively in depth in the first few videos, I want to keep these surface level so that anyone can understand them, including people who have never really delved into the world of spirits

I'll start off with myself: I had a pretty typical start to drinking, my preferred method of inebriation was to take shots, followed by some form of chase to completely wipe away any form of alcohol flavour. I hope my parents aren't watching this, but many of these behaviours were solidified on my trip to Europe with one of my best friends ethan.  

I actually remember the first time we drank on our trip. We did a tour with a company called contiki. We were meeting the group in London to start the trip, so we showed up a few days early to explore London. The first day we just walked all around the city, exploring, at the end of the day we decided to end our day with our first “independent” beers, so we decided to hit a Tesco’s, and got a few beers. 

We decided to have the beers in our hotel room. I remember the feeling of cracking those crappy, excessively large domestic beer bottles in our small hotel room, with the tiny tv playing a random show, and just feeling the most amazing feeling ever, here I am with my best friend in a country I've never been to, I guess this is what it feels like to be an adult I told myself. Fast forward to BEaujolais, a region in the middle of France. 

This is where we had our first taste of real alcohol, I guess I should mention that this trip was a camping trip; there were no hotel rooms other than two stops during the entire 2 months we were travelling, pretty much every night we slept in tents. Just like every prior night, we got to the campsite in Beaujolais, set up our tent, and hit up the grocery store with our friends Mark, Ryan and Devin to see what we could get to drink or eat. This is where we found the bottle to start it all, a bottle of canadian whisky that i'm pretty sure is not sold anywhere in Canada, mostly because it's a disgrace to the name. We drank it and passed out. 

I'll end this story now, because I don't want this to be a story video, but this trip showed me all forms of liquors. This bad relationship with alcohol carried on, where I really only consumed it for the effects. This slowly changed throughout  the years, and this was thanks to Ethan

I'm not sure if you've gotten this already from what I've said, but calling Ethan classy for his age is an understatement. Ethan got into higher end liquors quite early, I’d say pretty much when we became legal to drink here in Canada. He started experimenting with different glasses to drink from, and different high end liquors such as tequilas, whiskies, and rums. 

We had nights where he would make me cocktails, had me drink whisky, but I never really got the taste for it.
